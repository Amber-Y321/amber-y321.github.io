# Hey, thanks for your precious 3 min to know me better 😉

I've always been fascinated by how data uncovering small patterns can lead to big decisions. With a keen eye for detail and a strong focus on outcomes, I am good at capturing small but key abnormal data trends. Thanks to my rich experience in consulting and E-commerce, I am excellent at translating data language into Digestible insights whether it's through clear visualizations, compelling narratives, or actionable recommendations.

## **🌟 What I Do**
By day, I work with **Python, SQL, machine learning models** to extract insights from vast amounts of data. By night, you’ll find me experimenting with **new AI techniques, optimizing workflows, or exploring the next breakthrough in data science**.

I’ve worked across industries like **healthcare, E-commerce, and people analytics**, helping companies understand their customers, predict trends, and improve efficiency. Whether it’s **optimizing patient journeys in oncology healthcare** or **enhancing online sales strategies with Shopify data**, I love finding **the hidden connections in data**.

## **🔥 What Drives Me**
I thrive on the challenge of making raw data **not just understandable, but actionable**. Whether I’m:
- Designing **data pipelines** that automate insights,
- Or crafting **visualizations** that make data *click* for decision-makers,  
- Or Building an **Machine Leaning/ AI model** to predict behavior,
I believe data should work for people—not the other way around.

## **🔍 My Superpowers**
- 🔹 **Data Analytics:** Developing analysis flow to manipulate and visualize data.
- 🔹 **AI & Machine Learning:** Making predictions, optimizing decisions, and solving real-world problems.  
- 🔹 **Cloud & Big Data:** Using **AWS, Google Cloud, Snowflake** to scale analytics.  
- 🔹 **Storytelling with Data:** Turning raw numbers into *insights that matter*.  

## **🚀 What’s Next?**
I’m looking for ways to **push the boundaries of AI and data science**, collaborate with innovative minds, and build solutions that **make an impact**.
