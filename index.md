## 🧠 Ongoing Work @ LuxCouture

Currently, I'm a data consultant at a small business blending online and in-store retail. Here's what I've been contributing to:

- Built and automated an **end-to-end analytics pipeline**, pulling real-time Shopify sales data through API, preprocessing and engineering features in Python, applying segment-driven campaign strategy, and deploying results to an interactive Streamlit dashboard for marketing insights. (request API, Pandas, sickit-learn, Github)
- Designed an **LLM-powered customer segmentation model** to improve personalized user experiences with tailored product suggestions and targeted campaigns. (K-means, LLM, Jupyter Notebook, Python)
- Created interactive dashboards with **Streamlit + Python** to visualize marketing performance and customer segment behavior. (Plotly, Seaborn, Streamlit, Jupyter Notebook, Python)

💥 Business Impact:
> The segmentation-driven marketing strategy led to a +49% improvement in online sessions and +43.1% revenue lift compared to the same period last year, excluding fixed growth effects.
