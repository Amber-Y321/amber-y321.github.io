(Shopify API, Google Analytics Reporting API, Pandas, sickit-learn, Github)
- Designed an **LLM-powered customer segmentation model** to improve personalized user experiences with tailored product suggestions and targeted campaigns. (K-means, LLM, Jupyter Notebook, Python)
- Created interactive dashboards with **Streamlit + Python** to visualize marketing performance and customer segment behavior. (Plotly, Seaborn, Streamlit, Jupyter Notebook, Python)

💥 Business Impact:
> The segmentation-driven marketing strategy led to a +49% improvement in online sessions and +43.1% revenue lift compared to the same period last year, excluding fixed growth effects.
